			<h1>On September 25th, 2015 the United Nations announced a set of sustainable development goals for the world. One of those goals was to:</h1>
<h2>"Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020."</h2>

	<p>In 2016 the sub-Saharan nations averaged only 20% usage of the Internet, while the global average is 44%. In a report from the United Nations, 34 African countries (nearly all sub-Saharan) face severe structural impediment to sustainble development.</p>

	<p>While access to internet, both fixed and mobile, is expected to grow in the coming years, infrastructure remains a problem.  Only a third of sub-Saharan Africa has access to grid electricity. Beyond infrastructure problems, other barriers stand in the way.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lack of content in the diverse multitude of languages and dialects of Africa (which number around 2,500) </li>
		<li>Goverment control over internet, enabling the shutting down of all internet access during elections and crises in order to control supply of information </li>
		<li>Lack of skills to use the Internet and develop programs and content for local projects, i.e. "Digital Literacy" </li>
		<li>Data affordability</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This is not just about access to Facebook or Skype, the internet represents access to systems that can better enable healthcare, education, encourage economic development, and facilitate small business transactions. Access can also assist with other sustainability goals such as poverty reduction and improved health. For example, the basic messaging service, mHero, helped connect health workers to coordinate relief efforts during the Ebola crisis. </p>

	<p>M-Pesa, started in Kenya in 2007 by Safaricom has been revolutionary for communities, and is now available in Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Mozambique and Lesotho.  Their services offer 'mobile money', linked to a bank account and accesible on basic-feature phones using simple text systems.  The easier access to make and recieve payments has shown to have long-term effects on poverty reduction, gender equality, and employment opportunities. </p>

	<p>The 2016 numbers for some more developed countries around the world are as follows: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>United Kingdom 95%</li>
		<li>Japan 92%</li>
		<li>Canada 90%</li>
		<li>Germany 90%</li>
		<li>United States 76%</li>
		<li>Brazil 60%</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Data:</p>
<p>The data was pulled from The World Bank Open Data on February 11th, 2018. Details of the data, including meta data, can be found at <a href= https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS>data.worldbank.org</a>.  The information was collected from the International Telecommunication Union, World Telecommunication/ICT Development Report and database. Internet users are defined as individuals who have used the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc. and access can be fixed or via a mobile network. </p>

	<p>South Sudan gained their independence in 2011 and had data reported from 2013 on. Due the constraints of this lab I chose not to include their information. Their numbers for those years are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2013 - 3.83%</li>
			<li>2014 - 4.52%</li>
			<li>2015 - 5.50%</li>
			<li>2016 - 6.68% </li>
		</ul>
